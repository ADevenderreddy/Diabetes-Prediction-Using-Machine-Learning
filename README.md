# 🧠 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is a Machine Learning-based classification system that predicts whether a person is diabetic or not based on various medical attributes. The dataset used for this project is the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset `diabetes.csv` contains the following features:

- **Pregnancies**: Number of times pregnant  
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration  
- **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)  
- **SkinThickness**: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)  
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)  
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)  
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: Diabetes pedigree function  
- **Age**: Age in years  
- **Outcome**: 1 if diabetic, 0 otherwise (Target variable)

## 🚀 Project Objective
